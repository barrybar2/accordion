    heading: "What is love?",
    content:
      "Love can be understood, in evolutionary terms, as part of the survival instinct. Strong emotional bonds between organisms increase their chances of surviving long enough to procreate, thereby facilitating the continuation of the species. It's easy to see how natural selection favours individuals who form such attachments."

    heading: "Why does it always rain on me?",
    content:
      "It doesn't. While it's true that parts of Scotland are some of the wettest places in Europe, with annual rainfall up to 4,577 mm, it doesn't rain constantly. More to the point, precipitation is governed by geophysical laws, not human behaviour."

    heading: "Is there life on Mars?",
    content:
      "We still don't know for sure, but it's looking increasingly likely that some form of microbial life did once exist on Mars. Conditions in the planet's distant past were certainly conducive to it. Drilling samples recovered by NASA's Curiosity rover earlier this year were found to contain traces of sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon, all key chemical ingredients of microbial life."

    heading: "Where is my Mind?",
    content:
      "There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the so-called 'mind-body problem': dualism, materialism, and idealism. Dualism holds that the mind exists independently of the brain; materialism holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena; and idealism holds that only mental phenomena exist. Speaking in purely scientific terms, studies in functional neuroimaging have shown that three brain regions — the insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex — are critical for self-awareness."
