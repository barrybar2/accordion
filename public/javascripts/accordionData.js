    heading: "What is love?",
    content:
      "Love can be understood, in evolutionary terms, as part of the survival instinct. Strong emotional bonds between organisms increase their chances of surviving long enough to procreate, thereby facilitating the continuation of the species. It's easy to see how natural selection favours individuals who form such attachments."

    heading: "Why does it always rain on me?",
    content:
      "It doesn't. While it's true that parts of Scotland are some of the wettest places in Europe, with annual rainfall up to 4,577 mm, it doesn't rain constantly. More to the point, precipitation is governed by geophysical laws, not human behaviour."

    heading: "Is there life on Mars?",
    content:
      "We still don't know for sure, but it's looking increasingly likely that some form of microbial life did once exist on Mars. Conditions in the planet's distant past were certainly conducive to it. Drilling samples recovered by NASA's Curiosity rover earlier this year were found to contain traces of sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon, all key chemical ingredients of microbial life."

    heading: "Where is my Mind?",
    content:
      "There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the so-called 'mind-body problem': dualism, materialism, and idealism. Dualism holds that the mind exists independently of the brain; materialism holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena; and idealism holds that only mental phenomena exist. Speaking in purely scientific terms, studies in functional neuroimaging have shown that three brain regions — the insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex — are critical for self-awareness."

    heading: "Who wants to live forever?",
    content:
      "The doctrine of immortality is essential to many of the world's religions, and recent breakthroughs in cellular chemistry suggest that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging, may soon be achievable. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as cryonics, digital immortality, breakthroughs in rejuvenation, or predictions of an impending technological singularity."

    heading: "Why can't I be you?",
    content:
      "No two people's DNA blueprints are ever exactly alike. Not even 'identical' twins are identical in the genetic sense. And even if by some fluke they started out that way at conception, they wouldn't stay the same for long. According to molecular geneticist Shiva Singh: 'Cells are dividing as we develop and differentiate. More importantly, these cells may lose or acquire additional DNA. The genome is not static.'"

    heading: "Who knows where the time goes?",
    content:
      "It doesn't 'go' anywhere. Physics tells us that all moments exist equally, at once — it's only our consciousness that distinguishes the present from the past or future. According to Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: 'If life were a movie, physical reality would be the entire DVD: Future and past frames exist just as much as the present one.'"

    heading: "Where is the love?",
    content:
      "Mostly in the brain. Studies in neuroscience have identified a number of chemicals that appear to be associated with feelings of love. These can be broken down into two distinct phases. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin are more commonly found during the early, intense attraction stage of a relationship. Oxytocin and vasopressin seem to be more closely linked to long-term bonding. However, these neurotransmitter chemicals do generate physical sensations elsewhere in the body, similar to the fight-or-flight responses caused by fear or stress: decreased appetite, goosebumps, butterflies in the stomach, etc."
